# What is the data import wizard?

The Data Import Wizard is a custom DHIS2 application that helps you to; as the name suggests, import data into your DHIS 2 instance, from various sources. The sources you can import data from include:

1. Excel Spreadsheets
2. CSV files
3. JSON files
4. API Endpoints (Other systems or DHIS2 instances)
5. Go.DATA

The most recent version of the data import wizard (v2) has been improved to support the integration of DHIS2 with Go.DATA, but with bi-directional data import capabilities.

# How the Data Import Wizard works.
At the moment, we can import event data, aggregate data and organisation units. There are pages within the application that correspond to the kind of data you want to import, that is; <kbd>Tracker</kbd>, <kbd>Aggregate</kbd> and <kbd>Organisation</kbd>.

- [:book: Tracker *Import data into tracker or event program.*](/iwizard/tracker)
- [:heavy_plus_sign: Aggregate *Import aggregate data.*](/iwizard/aggregate)
- [:hospital: Organisation *Import organisation units.*](/iwizard/organisation)
- [:spiral_calendar: Schedule *Schedule data import using saved mapping.*](assets/iwizard/schedule)

# Data import steps

For each type of import, you go through the following steps to accomplish the import process. 
1. Add source system configuration
2. Define your destination (could be DHIS 2 or other system)
3. Define a mapping for your metadata. What objects need to be mapped in both systems
4. Utilize generated mapping to import the data. 


# Installation
At the moment, the data import wizard can be built from two repositories (core and utils). It also works along side a scheduler that processes data to import based on generated mappings.

1. [data-import-wizard-utils](https://github.com/HISP-Uganda/data-import-wizard-utils.git) - the utilities library that is also used by the data import wizard scheduler

1. [data-import-wizard-v2](https://github.com/HISP-Uganda/data-import-wizard-v2.git) - the core application
1. [data-import-wizard-scheduler](https://github.com/HISP-Uganda/data-import-wizard-v2.git) - the scheduler application.

## Recommended prerequisites.
1. Nodejs v18.16.0
1. Yarn


## Clone and build the utils repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HISP-Uganda/data-import-wizard-utils.git

cd data-import-wizard-utils

yarn install

yarn build

yarn link

# move 1 step out of the current directory
cd ..
```

## Clone and build the core repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HISP-Uganda/data-import-wizard-v2.git

cd data-import-wizard-v2

yarn install

yarn link "data-import-wizard-utils"

yarn build
```

A deployable `.zip` file can be found in `build/bundle`!



## Installing the wizard in a DHIS2 instance

Navigate to the `App Management` core application in your DHIS 2 instance.

## Launching the data import wizard.

## Building and runing the scheduler


# Tracker
The `Tracker` page walks you through steps that help you to import data from a source (Excel, CSV, JSON, API or Go.Data) to a DHIS2 program events data. We can also use the same page to configure importing from a DHIS2 program's events data to GoDATA.



The steps involved in the mapping and import process depend on whether DHIS2 is the source or destination system.

### Import Type <i class="mdi mdi-numeric-3-circle-outline"></i>
> **Step 3** - Specify import sorce and related configurations
{.is-success}

Once a program has been selected, you provide details for where you intend to import data from. in this step, we specify the `name`, `description` of the mapping, `import source` (Go.Data, Excel, CSV, JSON or API), `source authentication credentials`, and the `active outbreak` if the source is Go.DATA. Click the `Save` button at the bottom center of the page to save the provided details.

### Mapping Options <i class="mdi mdi-numeric-4-circle-outline"></i>
> **Step 4** - Set some mapping options
{.is-success}

In this step we set some mapping options that are critical to how the data import is made from the current mapping.

1. `Organisation unit Column` - select an organisation unit colum or specify a custom `JSON path` to where it can be picked
2. `Create Entities` - specifies if we are to create tracked entities
3. `Create Enrollments` - specifies whether to create enrollments upon import
4. `Update Entities` - specifies whether we shall update events as we import 
5. `Enrollment Date Column` - specify which field or column holds the enrollment date in the source data.
6. `Incident Date Column` - specify which field or column holds the encident date in the source data.

### Organisation Mapping <i class="mdi mdi-numeric-5-circle-outline"></i>
> **Step 5** - Mapping locations with DHIS2 Organisation Units
{.is-success}

This step shows the list of organisation units in DHIS2 and makes a provision for a select field that is used for mapping each organisation unit to a source location or organisation unit. 

There is also a provision for a free-form search field that can be used to search through DHIS2 organisation units so that you can quickly map a specific one.

|![Organisation Mapping](assets/iwizard/step5.png){.decor-shadow .radius-5 .elevation-3}|
|:--:|
| **List of organisation units to map** |

After mapping locations, you can check the `Show Mapped Organisations Only` checkbox to display the ones mapped so far. Remeber to hit the `Save` button to persist your current mapping. 

|![Organisation Mapping](assets/iwizard/step5a.png){.decor-shadow .radius-5 .elevation-3}|

| **Listing of mapped organisation units** |


If the source location ids match the DHIS organisation unit ids, the import wizard will auto map for you the organisation units. 

### Attribute Mapping <i class="mdi mdi-numeric-6-circle-outline"></i>

> **Step 6** - Map tracked entity attributes
{.is-success}

In this step we match the tracked entity attributes for the DHIS 2 program with attributes from the source. Typically, a list of attributes in DHIS2 is displayed in a table where a select field is provided to aid the matching.

First, you choose the `Tracked Entity Column` in your source data from the dropdown provided or you check the `Custom Tracked Entity Column` checkbox to specify a custom expression used to access it in your source data.

The attributes listed in the table can be marked as either `mandatory` or `unique` by ticking the corresponding checkboxes in the table row.

When mapping an attribute, it is also possible to create a custom `JSON Path` like mapping by ticking the checkbox in the `Map Manually` column. This is especially useful if the value of the attribute being mapped is deeply nested within the JSON object of data for Go.DATA or JSON sources.

There is also a provision for a free-form search field that can be used to search through DHIS2 program attributes so that you can quickly map a specific one.

### Events Mapping <i class="mdi mdi-numeric-7-circle-outline"></i>

> **Step 7** - Map data elements in the available program stages
{.is-success}

This step focusses on mapping data elements tracked in the different program stages of the DHIS2 event or tracker program to those data elements in the import source. 

In addition to the data element mapping, we set some configuration on how the data is imported in the respective program stages. The available configuration options include:

1. `Create Events` - specifies whether to create events in current stage upon data import
2. `Update Events` - specifies whether to update to update events when importing data
3. `Mark Event Date As Unique` - When set, this option ensures that the event date is unique for the tracked entities in the specif program stage.
4. `Event Date Column` - specifies what the event date maps to in the import source.
5. `Event Id Column` - specifies what the event ID maps to in the import source. The IDs hould be valid DHIS2 UIDs.

Click on one of the program stages (marked in <kbd style="color: red; background: lavender;">red</kbd> in graphic below), right below the steps to see the mapping configurations and the data elements to map for the stage.
